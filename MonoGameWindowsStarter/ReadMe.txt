## CIS 580 project 4

Although I had a real hard time developing what little i have, it technically meets the requirements for the project and i need to turn it in for points. I will continue to improve what I have and have a better produced game for project 5.

That being said, what can be done now is:

move the player with the arrow keys... that's it but trust me there will be a much improved version next time around
	- enemy spawn location
		- better enemy movement
	- artifacts to collect
	- background will be fix
	-etc..

sprite artwork is credited to Philipp Lenssen, except the background which is mine and I will have some edited version of Philipp's but they are still his work.
